## Tracking of Expiration Dates of Food for Donations
Out of Date? Time to Donate!

Our app helps grocery stores reduce waste. When fresh goods arrive, the app records their expiration dates. As soon as food expires, the app alerts local charities who can then pick it up for reuse. This simple process helps stores manage inventory, prevents waste, and supports the community

## Setup

1. Visit the [Flutter WebPage](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) and follow the guide to install Flutter
2. You'll need to download Android Studio for Android SDK (This is just for setup/ coding can still be done in your preferred editor VSCode, IntellIJ etc.)
3. For testing and debugging you have following options:
- download an android emulator to run the application there
- connect your phone via USB with your device and run the app directly from your phone
